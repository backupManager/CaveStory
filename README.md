# CaveStory
This is a small project that i am currently doing for my "Computer graphics & multimedia" University course.

"Cavestory" is about developing a fully working game using C++ but here i am pushing only those commits that are successfully
working so this project is still in development.

Note: This project is built upon Dev C++

While using stoi function dev c++ will run into error, so it is recommended to go to :

std::stoi was introduced in C++11 , Add -std=c++11 to your compiler options since you are most likely using an older and deprecated version or you can try going to Orwell dev c++ which has all the latest C++11 standards.
